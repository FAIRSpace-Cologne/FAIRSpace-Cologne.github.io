# Folder Structure

1. Establish the system and stay consistently.

2. Create folders based on file type, data or project stages.
   
   _(i.e. Raw Data, Audio files, Imaging data, Lab Books, Methodologies, etc.)_

3. How should files be organized in this folder?
   
   _(i.e. by dates, by classifications, etc.)_

4. Create ReadMe.txt to describe contents and conventions.
   
   It is not mandatory for each directory but in a higher level directory (see example).
