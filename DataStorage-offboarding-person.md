# Why do we plan for offboarding?

A team member left your project and followings could happen:
- some research data were stored on their work account and were wipe out by IT
- they have the access to the data repository and no one else can access it now
- no one knows the SOP and there is no documentation

Any of the situation could hinder your project, or even set the process back a couple of months.

It is for everyone's benefit to ensure the research can keep going on despite team member change.

### What should be done to keep the project going?
Recommended practices are:
- keeping good documentation (link to how-to-readme)
- applying file naming conventions (link to naming-convention)
- organizing files with well-structured directory (link to file-folder-str)
