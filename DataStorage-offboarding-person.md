# Why do we plan for offboarding?

A team member left your project and followings could happen:
- some research data were stored on their work account and were wipe out by IT
- they have the access to the data repository and no one else can access it now
- no one knows the SOP and there is no documentation

Any of these situations could hinder your research process or even delay it by a few months.

It is for everyone's benefit to ensure that research continues despite a change in team member.

### What should be done to keep the project going?
Recommended practices are:
- keep good documentation (link to how-to-readme)
- apply file naming conventions (link to naming-convention)
- organize files/dataset with well-structured directory (link to file-folder-str)
