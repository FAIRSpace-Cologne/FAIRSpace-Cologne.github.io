# Why Do We Need To Back Up Data?

Accidents happen every day. Having backups can protect you and your team against human errors, malicious attacks, hardware failure and natural disasters.

### Develop a data backup plan and identify the contact person

It could be one of your team members or a research data management team who is responsible for backup maintenance. 

They should be able to answer questions like:

- How to back up data?

- How often to back up data? 

- Where is the backup stored?

- How to access the backup if needed to recover the data?

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure the data can be recovered from the backup.
>
>Try it before you actually need it.


### How many backups should I have? 

An easy-to-follow rule is <b>3-2-1 Backup Rule</b> that always makes sure your data have: 

  - <b>three</b> copies of data 
  
  - stored in <b>two</b> different types of media

  - keep <b>one</b> copy off-site

For example, one original data is stored in a secure server, one copy in a portable hard drive and one copy in a shared cloud folder.
