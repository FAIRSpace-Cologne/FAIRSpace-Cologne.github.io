# How to write a README file

### What is a README file?

It provides a clear and concise description of the files in the folder and all relevant information that you at a later date or researchers from another institute could correctly interpret the files and enhance the [reproducibility]().

It is recommended to create the README file at the beginning of your research and regularly update it throughout the research.

### README file is created to answer various questions, for example:

 - Where to [find]() a specific dataset?
 
 - Which file has been updated? What is the nature of the update?
 
 - What is the file naming convention?
 
 - Why is a certain practice/model applied?

### Where should I place the README file?

It could be at a higher-level directory, for example:

<pre>
 Project_A
   |- README_Data.txt
   |- Raw Data
   |- Processed Data
   |- Reference Data
   |- Analysis
</pre>

In this README file, it could describe the content in each folder, the research objectives, required information for the intepretation and [reuse]() of the data, who to contact for questions and so on.

You could also create a README file for a lower-level directory, for example:

<pre>
 Project_A
   |- Data
   |   |- Raw Data
   |   |   |- README_rawData.txt
   |   |   |- Dataset_1-1.xml
   |   |   |- Dataset_2-1.csv
   |   |   |- Dataset_2-2.csv
</pre>

This README file could contain the naming convention, definition of symbols and codes in the dataset, list of variables, units for measurement, locations for data generation/collection, collabortors, who to contact for questions and so on. 

>[!NOTE]
> Add details to the name, _e.g. README_rawData.txt, README_analysis.txt_

### Creating README file template

The recommended minimum content for enhancing [reproducibility]() is <mark>highlighted</mark>.
