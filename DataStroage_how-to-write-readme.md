# How to write a README file

### What is a README file?

It provides a clear and concise description of the files in the folder and all relevant information that yourself at a later date or researchers from another institute could correctly interpret the files.

### README file is created to answer various questions:

 - Where to find a specific dataset?
 
 - Which file has been updated? What is the nature of the update?
 
 - What is the file naming convention?
 
 - Why applied a certain practice/model?
