The directory `/FAIRSpace-Cologne.github.io/FAIRSpace-Cologne.github.io/assets/fonts` is intended to hold font files used throughout the website. Since you requested the contents of this directory, it will typically contain font files (e.g., `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`, etc.). However, as no specific font files were provided, I will indicate that this directory is currently empty.

assets/fonts is intentionally left blank.
