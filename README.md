## Biomedical Data Lifecycle Stages

The Biomedical Data Lifecycle represents the stages of data handling from collection to publication. The core stages are outlined below, each integral to the overall management and use of your research data. Although the process is generally linear, it is common to revisit and refine earlier stages as your project progresses.

### 1. **Plan & Design**
   - **Objective:** Develop a comprehensive plan for managing data throughout the research project.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Create a Data Management Plan (DMP) detailing how data will be collected, organized, and stored.
     - Define data resources and onboarding processes for team members.
     - Plan for data security, privacy, and compliance with relevant regulations.

### 2. **Collect & Create**
   - **Objective:** Collect and integrate data in a structured and organized manner.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Implement standardized procedures for data collection.
     - Ensure data is organized and integrated according to predefined criteria.
     - Document the data collection methods and processes for reproducibility.

### 3. **Analyze & Collaborate**
   - **Objective:** Process and analyze data with a focus on collaboration and documentation.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Use appropriate tools and methods for data analysis.
     - Maintain collaborative workflows and document all analytical processes.
     - Share intermediate results with collaborators to facilitate feedback and refinement.

### 4. **Store & Manage**
   - **Objective:** Manage data storage throughout all stages of the lifecycle.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Store data securely and ensure it is easily retrievable.
     - Implement data backup and recovery procedures.
     - Manage data access permissions and track changes to data.

### 5. **Evaluate & Archive**
   - **Objective:** Assess and archive essential research records.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Identify which data and records are essential for long-term retention.
     - Evaluate the need for data retention based on project requirements and regulatory guidelines.
     - Archive data in a manner that ensures long-term accessibility and preservation.

### 6. **Share & Disseminate**
   - **Objective:** Make data available and accessible to the broader community.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Establish mechanisms for data sharing, including repositories or publication platforms.
     - Support data dissemination efforts to maximize reach and impact.
     - Provide clear documentation and metadata to facilitate understanding and use by others.

### 7. **Publish & Reuse**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the data can be utilized by other researchers for further studies.
   - **Actions:** 
     - Publish data in accessible formats and repositories.
     - Promote the reuse of data by providing comprehensive documentation and metadata.
     - Encourage citation and acknowledgment of data sources in related research.
