## Introduction

Effective data management is critical for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and reusability of research data. This repository outlines the data management cycle based on the principles of **Data Stewardship for Open Science** as described by Barend Mons. Each step in this cycle is crucial for maintaining the integrity and usability of data throughout the research process. It aims to assist researchers, data stewards, and institutions in effectively managing research data following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.

## Data Cycle Steps

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 1: Design of Experiment</strong></summary>

The first step in the data management cycle is the **Design of Experiment**. During this phase, researchers outline the scientific questions and hypotheses that will guide their study. This stage involves determining the type of data required, the experimental conditions, and the overall methodological framework. Proper planning at this stage ensures that the data collected will be relevant and sufficient for the research objectives.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 2: Data Design and Planning</strong></summary>

The **Data Design and Planning** phase involves setting up the infrastructure and protocols for data collection. This includes deciding on data formats, metadata standards, and storage solutions. It's essential to consider the FAIR principles at this stage to ensure that data will be easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in the future.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 3: Data Capture (Equipment Phase)</strong></summary>

In the **Data Capture** phase, data is collected using various instruments and equipment. This step requires strict adherence to data collection protocols to ensure data quality and consistency. Researchers must also document the data collection process thoroughly, including any calibration or standardization procedures applied to the equipment.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 4: Data Processing and Curation</strong></summary>

The **Data Processing and Curation** stage involves transforming raw data into a usable format. This includes data cleaning, normalization, and validation. Data curation also involves the organization and documentation of data to facilitate its long-term preservation and accessibility.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 5: Data Linking and Integration</strong></summary>

During the **Data Linking and Integration** phase, different data sources are connected to provide a comprehensive view of the research findings. This step might involve integrating data from multiple experiments, linking datasets with external resources, or creating relational databases.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 6: Data Analysis and Interpretation</strong></summary>

In the **Data Analysis and Interpretation** phase, the processed data is analyzed to extract meaningful insights. Researchers apply statistical methods, computational models, and visualization techniques to interpret the data and answer the original research questions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 7: Information and Insight Publishing</strong></summary>

The final step is **Information and Insight Publishing**. This phase involves sharing the results and data with the broader scientific community. Data and insights should be published in a way that ensures reproducibility and transparency, adhering to the FAIR principles.
