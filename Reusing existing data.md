# Is There Pre-existing Data?

With the increasing availability of data in reusable formats, existing data collections and associated services (OPEDAS) can potentially address parts of your research questions or be crucial for interpreting your own data.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Searching for OPEDAS</strong></summary>

- **Identify Reusable Datasets:** Search for OPEDAS that can reduce the need to generate new datasets, thereby saving time and resources.
- **Accessibility and Licensing:** Verify the accessibility and licensing terms of the datasets to ensure they can be legally and ethically reused.
- **Interoperability:** Assess the need for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to integrate OPEDAS with your existing data.
- **Citation and Acknowledgment:** Understand how to properly cite and acknowledge the use of OPEDAS in your research.
- **Collaboration with Data Owners:** Consider how to actively involve OPEDAS owners in your research to make optimal use of their data.

  <summary><strong>Where is the Data Available?</strong></summary>
  
- Determine if you need the entire dataset or specific parts to manage storage and computational costs.
- Assess whether downloading the OPEDAS is necessary or if an API is available for access.
- Review the licensing and citation policies to ensure compliance.
- Confirm that using the data does not impose restrictions on publishing or further usage of your results. If uncertain, contact the data owner for clarification.
- Maintain the original data and metadata without alterations unless properly documented and annotated.
- Ensure that online data sources are reliable and will remain accessible under the same conditions.
- For non-authorized resources, download and store the data locally with comprehensive provenance documentation.
- Evaluate the performance implications of accessing data online versus locally.

  <summary><strong>Which Format to Use?</strong></summary>

Several datasets, and, in particular, reference data resources may be available in different formats. You need to be fully aware of the data formats used, the limitations of the format, the possible license restrictions, and thus how you may or may not be able to reuse these data.

  - Investigate the available data formats from selected OPEDAS sources.
  - Choose the format that best aligns with your analysis requirements.
  - If the desired format is unavailable, reach out to the resource owner to discuss whether the data can be made available in that format.
  - Be cognizant of the limitations and licensing restrictions associated with different data formats to ensure proper reuse.

  <summary><strong>Using Reference Data</strong></summary>

Reference data, defined as OPEDAS with a status as a reference dataset, are essential for interpreting other data.

- **Understanding Reference Sources:**
  - Familiarize yourself with the range of reference data sources relevant to your study.

- **Authority and Validity:**
  - Evaluate the authority, versioning, and licensing of these databases to ensure their reliability.

- **Reproducibility:**
  - Ensure the ability to reproduce reused data by recording the specific version used and archiving the data appropriately.

- **Automated Workflows:**
  - Utilize existing workflows or methods to automatically check your data against reference data, avoiding redundant efforts.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Contacting the Owner of the Data</strong></summary>

Some OPEDAS require explicit consent or assistance from the data owner for usage.

  - Check the conditions under which you can get access.
  - Check ownership and use restrictions (e.g., commercial use).
  - Prepare a clear explanation of why you want to reuse the data and for what purpose.
  - Ensure the level of explanation fits the owner.
  - Check verbally and/or in writing with the owner about potential restrictions that might not be explicit in the metadata of the OPEDAS.
  - Double-check with the owners as to how long they intend or guarantee to keep the data available in the same format and version.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is the Data Resource Versioned?</strong></summary>

  - Check the versioning policies of the OPEDAS source and consider the consequences.
  - Decide what version to use.
  - Decide what you will do when updates are released.
  - In case you always want to use a given version, make sure you will always have access to that version.
    - This means that if the source does not freeze versions, you may have to download, store, and document the version you will use.
  - Make sure you extensively record and publish which version you used in which analysis.
  - If possible, subscribe to updates of the resource so that you will be aware of updates.
  - If there is no clear update policy, contact the owner or custodian of the resource and propose adding information on the update policy.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is Reconsent Needed?</strong></summary>

When OPEDAS are subject to informed consent rules, ensure that the consent covers the specific purpose of your study.

  - Check the consensus statements associated with the data (if any).
  - Contact the data owner actively when there is any doubt about the legal issues associated with the reuse of the data.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Harmonizing Different Sources of OPEDAS</strong></summary>

- **Data Element Formats:**
  - Examine the formats in which data elements are presented across different OPEDAS.

- **Terminology Systems:**
  - Ensure consistency in terminology systems used and address any implications for your analysis pipelines.

- **Data Capture Choices:**
  - Decide how the formats and ontologies of OPEDAS will influence your own data capture strategies.

- **Metadata Handling:**
  - Determine if metadata or data elements require translation or mapping to ontologies.

- **Data Linkability:**
  - Where possible, reformat data to make it linkable and provide feedback to OPEDAS owners.
