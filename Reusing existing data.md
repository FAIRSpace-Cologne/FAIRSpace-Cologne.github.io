# Is There Pre-existing Data?

With the increasing availability of data in reusable formats, existing data collections and associated services (OPEDAS) can potentially address parts of your research questions or be crucial for interpreting your own data.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Searching for OPEDAS</strong></summary>

- **Identify Reusable Datasets:** Search for OPEDAS that can reduce the need to generate new datasets, thereby saving time and resources.
- **Accessibility and Licensing:** Verify the accessibility and licensing terms of the datasets to ensure they can be legally and ethically reused.
- **Interoperability:** Assess the need for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to integrate OPEDAS with your existing data.
- **Citation and Acknowledgment:** Understand how to properly cite and acknowledge the use of OPEDAS in your research.
- **Collaboration with Data Owners:** Engage with OPEDAS owners to maximize the utility of their data and foster collaborative research efforts.

  <summary><strong>Where is the Data Available?</strong></summary>

- **Data Scope and Size:**
  - Determine if you need the entire dataset or specific parts to manage storage and computational costs.
  - Assess whether downloading the OPEDAS is necessary or if an API is available for access.

- **Reuse Policies:**
  - Review the licensing and citation policies to ensure compliance.
  - Confirm that using the data does not impose restrictions on publishing or further usage of your results. If uncertain, contact the data owner for clarification.

- **Data Integrity and Documentation:**
  - Maintain the original data and metadata without alterations unless properly documented and annotated.
  - Ensure that online data sources are reliable and will remain accessible under the same conditions.

- **Data Provenance:**
  - For non-authorized resources, download and store the data locally with comprehensive provenance documentation.
  - Evaluate the performance implications of accessing data online versus locally.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Which Format to Use?</strong></summary>

- **Data Formats:**
  - Investigate the available data formats from selected OPEDAS sources.
  - Choose the format that best aligns with your analysis requirements.

- **Format Availability:**
  - If the desired format is unavailable, reach out to the resource owner to request data in that format.

- **Awareness of Limitations:**
  - Be cognizant of the limitations and licensing restrictions associated with different data formats to ensure proper reuse.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Using Reference Data</strong></summary>

Reference data, defined as OPEDAS with a status as a reference dataset, are essential for interpreting other data.

- **Understanding Reference Sources:**
  - Familiarize yourself with the range of reference data sources relevant to your study.

- **Authority and Validity:**
  - Evaluate the authority, versioning, and licensing of these databases to ensure their reliability.

- **Reproducibility:**
  - Ensure the ability to reproduce reused data by recording the specific version used and archiving the data appropriately.

- **Automated Workflows:**
  - Utilize existing workflows or methods to automatically check your data against reference data, avoiding redundant efforts.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Contacting the Owner of the Data</strong></summary>

Some OPEDAS require explicit consent or assistance from the data owner for usage.

- **Access Conditions:**
  - Verify the conditions under which you can access the data.

- **Ownership and Use Restrictions:**
  - Understand any ownership and use restrictions, including limitations on commercial use.

- **Purpose Explanation:**
  - Clearly articulate why you intend to reuse the data and the purposes of your study.

- **Communication:**
  - Ensure that your explanation is appropriate for the data owner and confirm any implicit restrictions not detailed in the metadata.

- **Data Availability Assurance:**
  - Confirm with the owners how long the data will remain available in the same format and version.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is the Data Resource Versioned?</strong></summary>

- **Versioning Policies:**
  - Review the versioning policies of the OPEDAS source and understand the implications for your research.

- **Version Selection:**
  - Decide which version of the data to use and establish a plan for handling updates.

- **Access to Versions:**
  - Ensure continuous access to the chosen version, especially if the source does not freeze versions, by downloading, storing, and documenting it.

- **Documentation:**
  - Record and publish the specific versions used in your analyses.

- **Updates Subscription:**
  - Subscribe to updates from the resource to stay informed about any changes.

- **Update Policy Clarification:**
  - If no clear update policy exists, propose adding this information by contacting the resource owner or custodian.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is Reconsent Needed?</strong></summary>

When OPEDAS are subject to informed consent rules, ensure that the consent covers the specific purpose of your study.

- **Consensus Statements:**
  - Review any consensus statements associated with the data.

- **Legal Clarifications:**
  - Proactively contact the data owner to clarify any legal issues regarding data reuse.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Harmonizing Different Sources of OPEDAS</strong></summary>

- **Data Element Formats:**
  - Examine the formats in which data elements are presented across different OPEDAS.

- **Terminology Systems:**
  - Ensure consistency in terminology systems used and address any implications for your analysis pipelines.

- **Data Capture Choices:**
  - Decide how the formats and ontologies of OPEDAS will influence your own data capture strategies.

- **Metadata Handling:**
  - Determine if metadata or data elements require translation or mapping to ontologies.

- **Data Linkability:**
  - Where possible, reformat data to make it linkable and provide feedback to OPEDAS owners.
