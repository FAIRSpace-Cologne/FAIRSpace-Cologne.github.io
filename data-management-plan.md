# Data Management Planning

Data management planning involves outlining the approach you intend to take for handling the data and documentation produced throughout a project. It requires proactive consideration of the best ways to prevent issues or unforeseen expenses related to data management, while ensuring that the research data can have maximum scientific impact, even after the project concludes.

The strategies for managing project data are typically formalized in a Data Management Plan (DMP). This document details various aspects of the data management process, addressing what happens before, during, and after the project's completion.

Having a DMP and properly managing your research data is considered good research practice. It enhances the efficiency of your work, supports collaboration within your team, and promotes the effective use of services and tools. Additionally, a well-structured DMP contributes to making your research data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

> [!Important]
>Research organizations and funding bodies often mandate the inclusion of a Data Management Plan (DMP) either as part of the grant application process or after the project has been funded. Therefore, it’s essential to take into account the guidelines, policies, and tools specified by your funder for data management planning.
>
>Data management should be planned from the outset of a research project. Ideally, the DMP should be completed before data collection begins. However, the DMP is a dynamic document that should be revised as the project evolves, reflecting changes such as updates to infrastructure, research software, or new collaborations.

### What is a Data Management Plan?

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlines how data will be managed during and after a research project. It provides a clear framework for the acquisition, handling, storage, sharing, and archiving of research data throughout the project's lifecycle. While many funding agencies, particularly government bodies, require a DMP as part of their grant applications, having one is considered good practice even if external funding isn't involved.

A DMP is a "living document," meaning it should be updated as the research evolves. Since the research process often takes unexpected turns, your DMP may need adjustments to reflect changes in methods, tools, or collaborations. It's important to review and revise the DMP regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your project’s needs.

For PhD students, as well as those participating in projects funded by programs like Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, and various state plans, the preparation and presentation of a DMP is often mandatory, ensuring a structured approach to data management throughout the research process.

### Who uses data management plans?

**Grant Applications**
In both public and private sectors, researchers seek funding from various agencies to support research and innovation projects. DMPs help mitigate risks by ensuring data owners carefully consider the value and responsibility associated with managing research data, including security and disaster recovery measures. This benefits both the researchers and the funding agencies, creating transparency in how data will be managed throughout the project.

**Data Governance in Business**
In corporate settings, DMPs can be valuable tools for managing new data initiatives. They help stakeholders understand the significance of new data sources and how these can align with business goals. As technologies like hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and edge computing contribute to the explosion of big data, organizations will increasingly rely on DMPs to manage the complexity and ensure their data systems remain secure, efficient, and compliant with governance protocols.

### Key elements of a Data Management Plan (DMP)

A DMP typically covers a range of important aspects related to the handling of data throughout the lifecycle of a project. While different funders and institutions may have specific requirements, a comprehensive DMP should address the following key elements:
  
<details>
  <summary>1. Project Overview</summary>
  Provide general information about the project, including its objectives and the types of data that will be generated and used. This section sets the stage for understanding the context and scope of data management needs.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Description of Datasets</summary>
  Outline the types of data to be collected or generated. Specify the data sources, formats, volume, and whether the data will be static or dynamic. This helps in understanding the complexity of data management and storage needs.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Metadata and Documentation</summary>
  Detail how the data will be described and documented. This includes metadata standards, ontologies, and naming conventions that will be followed to ensure data is well-documented and easily understandable for others who may use it in the future. Clear metadata helps in organizing and making the data discoverable and reusable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Storage, Security, and Backup Solutions</summary>
  Explain how the data will be stored, secured, and backed up during the project. Address questions about where the data will be stored (e.g., local servers, cloud storage), the frequency of backups, and the strategies for data protection against loss or breaches.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Data Sharing and Access</summary>
  Describe how and when the data will be shared, including access policies. Explain where the data will be published (e.g., in repositories), the timeline for making the data accessible, and any restrictions on access, such as embargo periods or controlled access due to privacy concerns. Also, specify how others will be able to discover and reuse the data, ensuring compliance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access</summary>
  Outline the plans for long-term preservation and archiving of the data. Explain the steps that will be taken to ensure data is accessible after the project ends, including the repositories where it will be stored and how it will be maintained for future use. Considerations for the length of time data will be archived should also be included.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. Ethical and Legal Considerations</summary>
  Address any ethical or legal issues related to data management, such as privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property rights, and licenses. This section should also include how sensitive data, like personally identifiable information (PII), will be managed to comply with ethical standards and legal regulations.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. Costs and Resources</summary>
  Provide details about the resources needed for data management, including the cost of storage, tools, personnel, and infrastructure. Some funding agencies require an estimation of the budget necessary to ensure that data management processes are adequately supported.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. Roles and Responsibilities</summary>

### When should the DMP be ready?

For projects funded under Horizon Europe, an initial version of the Data Management Plan (DMP) is required to be submitted as a deliverable, typically by the sixth month of the project.

The DMP is regarded as a “living document,” which means it should be updated regularly to reflect any changes or decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. For projects that extend beyond 12 months, an updated version of the DMP must be submitted as another deliverable.

At the conclusion of the project, a final version of the DMP must be provided, detailing how the data was managed and shared throughout the project's duration.

### Choosing the right template for your DMP

When drafting a DMP, it's important to select an appropriate template that aligns with the requirements of your funding agency or institution. Numerous DMP templates are available, each tailored to specific guidelines and needs. Additionally, there are ongoing initiatives aimed at creating templates that support machine-actionable DMPs.

Different funding bodies may have their own preferences regarding DMP templates, which could include specific requirements or recommendations. Similarly, your institution may also provide guidance on the preferred template to use. These templates may come in various formats, including lists of questions or machine-actionable formats that facilitate easier data management.

To ensure compliance, it is advisable to check the documentation provided by your funding agency or institution. You may also reach out to them directly for clarification on their DMP template requirements.

For example, [Science Europe](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/open-science/research-data-management/) offers a foundational DMP template that can serve as a useful starting point. Furthermore, you can refer to the DMP guidelines outlined in the [Horizon Europe Programme Guide](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/programme-guide_horizon_en.pdf) and the Horizon Europe Annotated Model Grant Agreement.

### Choosing the right tool for writing your DMP

When it comes to drafting a DMP, you have the option to write it offline using a downloaded template in a text document format. However, numerous web-based DMP tools can significantly streamline this process. These tools often include various DMP templates and provide guidance for interpreting and answering questions. Some even allow for collaboration and track progress since a DMP is a living document.

#### Considerations
- Verify which DMP tool is recommended or provided by your funding agency.
- Check for recommendations or tools provided by your institution.
- Ensure the chosen tool includes the specific DMP template you need.
- If you want to create a machine-actionable DMP, confirm that the tool can export it in a machine-actionable format (e.g., JSON) rather than just as a PDF.
