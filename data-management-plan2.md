# Data Management Planning

Data management planning is essential for handling data and documentation throughout a project. The strategies for managing project data are typically formalized in a Data Management Plan (DMP) 
A good **Data Management Plan (DMP)** not only ensures data integrity but also maximizes the scientific impact of research data, even after the project ends.

### Why Create a DMP?
- **Good Research Practice**: It enhances collaboration and supports efficient workflows.
- **FAIR Data**: Ensures your data is **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**.
- **Funder Requirements**: Many organizations require a DMP as part of the grant process.

### What is a DMP?

A **Data Management Plan (DMP)** outlines how data will be handled during and after a project.
It provides a clear framework for the acquisition, handling, storage, sharing, and archiving of research data throughout the project's lifecycle.
It’s a **living document**, updated regularly to reflect changes in methods, tools, or collaborations. It's important to review and revise the DMP regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your project’s needs.

DMPs are typically required by:
- **Funding agencies** (e.g., Horizon Europe, Horizon 2020)
- **Institutions** or **collaborations**

> [!Important]
> For PhD students, as well as those participating in projects funded by programs like Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, and various state plans, the preparation and presentation of a DMP is often mandatory, ensuring a structured approach to data management throughout the research process.

### Key Elements of a DMP
While different funders and institutions may have specific requirements, a strong DMP should address the following:

<details>
  <summary>1. Project Overview</summary>
  Provide general information about the project, including its objectives and the types of data that will be generated and used. This section sets the stage for understanding the context and scope of data management needs.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Description of Datasets</summary>
  Outline the types of data to be collected or generated. Specify the data sources, formats, volume, and whether the data will be static or dynamic. This helps in understanding the complexity of data management and storage needs.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Metadata and Documentation</summary>
  Detail how the data will be described and documented. This includes metadata standards, ontologies, and naming conventions that will be followed to ensure data is well-documented and easily understandable for others who may use it in the future. Clear metadata helps in organizing and making the data discoverable and reusable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Storage, Security, and Backup Solutions</summary>
  Explain how the data will be stored, secured, and backed up during the project. Address questions about where the data will be stored (e.g., local servers, cloud storage), the frequency of backups, and the strategies for data protection against loss or breaches.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Data Sharing and Access</summary>
  Describe how and when the data will be shared, including access policies. Explain where the data will be published (e.g., in repositories), the timeline for making the data accessible, and any restrictions on access, such as embargo periods or controlled access due to privacy concerns. Also, specify how others will be able to discover and reuse the data, ensuring compliance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access</summary>
  Outline the plans for long-term preservation and archiving of the data. Explain the steps that will be taken to ensure data is accessible after the project ends, including the repositories where it will be stored and how it will be maintained for future use. Considerations for the length of time data will be archived should also be included.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. Ethical and Legal Considerations</summary>
  Address any ethical or legal issues related to data management, such as privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property rights, and licenses. This section should also include how sensitive data, like personally identifiable information (PII), will be managed to comply with ethical standards and legal regulations.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. Costs and Resources</summary>
  Provide details about the resources needed for data management, including the cost of storage, tools, personnel, and infrastructure. Some funding agencies require an estimation of the budget necessary to ensure that data management processes are adequately supported.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. Roles and Responsibilities</summary>
  Define who is responsible for managing the data throughout the project. This may include identifying team members in charge of storage, documentation, security, and sharing. Clear assignment of responsibilities ensures that all data management tasks are properly executed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10. Policies for Reuse and Licensing</summary>
  Specify the conditions under which the data may be reused by other researchers. This includes defining any licensing terms, such as open data licenses or restrictions that apply to certain datasets.
</details>

### Who Uses DMPs?

- **Researchers**: To ensure smooth data handling throughout the research lifecycle.
- **Businesses**: For managing new data sources, especially in complex systems (AI, IoT, hybrid cloud).
- **Grant Applicants**: To meet funding requirements and show accountability in data management.

---

### When Should the DMP Be Ready?
A DMP should ideally be completed before data collection begins. However, it’s important to remember that it’s a living document, evolving as the project progresses. 
Updates may be needed due to changes in infrastructure, research software, or new collaborations.
- **Initial Plan**: Many funders, such as Horizon Europe, require submission within the first 6 months. Check your specific funder's guidelines for precise timelines.
- **Updates**: Revise regularly, particularly for projects lasting over 12 months or when there are significant changes.
- **Final Version**: Submit a comprehensive version at the project’s conclusion, detailing how the data was managed and shared.

> [!Note]
> Each funding agency may have specific requirements for DMP timelines. Always review the relevant documentation from your funding body or institution to ensure compliance.

### DMP Templates and Tools

When it comes to drafting a DMP, you have the option to write it offline using a downloaded template in a text document format. However, numerous web-based DMP tools can significantly streamline this process. 
These tools often include various DMP templates and provide guidance for interpreting and answering questions. Some even allow for collaboration and track progress since a DMP is a living document.

> [!Note]
> - Different funding bodies may have their own preferences regarding DMP templates
> - Verify which DMP tool/template is recommended or provided by your funding agency.
> - Ensure the chosen tool includes the specific DMP template you need.
> For example, [Science Europe](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/open-science/research-data-management/) offers a foundational DMP template that can serve as a useful starting point.
> Furthermore, you can refer to the DMP guidelines outlined in the [Horizon Europe Programme Guide](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/programme-guide_horizon_en.pdf) and the Horizon Europe Annotated Model Grant Agreement.
