# Data Repository

In generally, data repository is a storage place for data. Storing research data during research is just as important as storing data after research is completed. It is recommanded by [DFG](https://zenodo.org/records/6472827#.ZD-taYTP02w) as a good scientific practice to store the research data for at least ten years. Additionally, a key aspect of FAIR prinicples is to ensure that your reseach data remains [findable]() and [accessible]() long after the research project is completed. 

### What can your research project benefit from using data repository?

Data repository can be more than a cloud storage for your research data (link to back up data). Based on various features that the data repository provides, you can:

- organize and manage your research data
- search for other's research data (link to referece data, reuse data)
- share data with the community and increase the scientific impact of your research
- publish your research
- archive your research data for long-term (link to archiving data) <!--further provide repo for archiving data and things to be aware of etc-->

### How to choose a data repository?

Choosing a data repository in the planning phase of a research project can be challenging.

You can first check the resources provided by your institute ([Data storage and share by University of Cologne](https://rrzk.uni-koeln.de/daten-speichern-teilen)). This could give you a general idea of how your fellow researchers manage their research data. 

You can also consider following aspects before looking for a data repository:

1. <b>Purpose</b>: To figure out which data repository to choose, it is best to first know what you need. As mentioned earlier, you can use a data repository to publish, store, organize data, etc. Depending on your needs and the scope of research, you can use more than one data repository to serve different purposes.

2. <b>Cost</b>: Is there a budget for data repository? If yes, for how long? For some funding, the budget is only made available during the research period. For long-term storage of research data, a free data repository to archive your research data after research is completed can be a good choice.

3. <b>File size</b>: Data repositories typically have clear guideline for overall file size and individual file size per upload. If you don't have an estimated file size of your research, ask your PI or others who have done similar research for reference. 

4. <b>File type</b>: The data repository might only allow certain file types to be uploaded. Review documentation of dataset output file type and software settings or ask PI what file types would be generated from your research.

5. <b>Access control</b>: Should your research data be public or only accessible to a limited extent? Depending on your funding requirements or the policy of your institute, you may be required to have open access to your research data. Note that some data repositories have open access by default. 

Other features of the repository that may be helpful for your research include version control, uploading a folder, syncing with your desktop, etc.
