# Data Repository

Generally data repository is a storage place for data. A key aspect of FAIR prinicples is to ensure your reseach data remains [findable]() and [accessible]() long after the research project completes. It is also a good scientific practice to store the research data for at least ten years (DFG guidline 17).

Data repository could be cloud storage of your research data (link to back up data) as well as:

- organizing and managing data
- searching for other's data (link to referece data, reuse data)
- sharing data with collaborators from another site
- publishing data

### How to choose a data repository?

To choose a data repository at the planning phase of research project can be challenging.

Here are a couple of things to consider before looking for a data repository:

1. Purpose. To figure out which data repository to choose is best first to know what do you need. As mentioned eariler, you could use a data repositpory for publishing, storage, colloborate with external partners, organizing data, etc.

2. Cost. Is there a budget for data repository? If yes, for how long? Some funding only provides budget during the research period. For the long-term storage of research data, free data repository to archive your research data after research completes may be a good choice. 

3. File size. Data repository usually have clear policy for total file size as well as single file size per upload. If you don't have an estimate file size of your reserach, ask your PI or others who has done similiar research. 

4. File type. Some repository only accept certain file types. Check the documentation of the dataset output file type, software setting or ask IT.  

5. Access control. Do you want your research data public or restricted access? Depends on the funding requirement or policy of your institution, you may be obligated to set open access to your reserch data. Beware that some data repository has open access as default. 

Other features of the repository that could be helpful for your reserach version control, allow for folder upload, sync with your desktop, etc. 

(NOTE) Try different functions of the data repository interface to ensure it fits your needs.

Depends on your need and the scope of research, you may use more than one data repository to satisfy different purposes.
