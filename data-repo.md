# Data Repository

Generally data repository is a storage place for data. A key aspect of FAIR prinicples is to ensure your reseach data remains [findable]() and [accessible]() long after the research project completes. It is also a good scientific practice to store the research data for at least ten years ([DFG Code of Conduct 3.17](https://zenodo.org/records/6472827#.ZD-taYTP02w)).

### What could your research project benefit from using data repository?

Data repository could be the cloud storage for your research data (link to back up data) or:

- organizing and managing data
- searching for other's data (link to referece data, reuse data)
- sharing data with collaborators from another site
- publishing data
- archiving data (link to archiving data) <!--further provide repo for archiving data and things to be aware of etc-->

### How to choose a data repository?

To choose a data repository at the planning phase of research project can be challenging.

You can first check the resources provided by your institution ([Data storage and share by University of Cologne](https://rrzk.uni-koeln.de/daten-speichern-teilen)). This could give you a general idea of how your fellow researchers manage their research data. 

You can also consider following aspects before looking for a data repository:

1. <b>Purpose</b>: To figure out which data repository to choose, it's best to first know what you need. As mentioned eariler, you could use a data repositpory for publishing, storage, colloborate with external partners, organizing data, etc. Depends on your needs and the scope of research, you may use more than one data repository to satisfy different purposes. 

2. <b>Cost</b>: Is there a budget for data repository? If yes, for how long? Some funding only provides budget during the research period. For the long-term storage of research data, free data repository to archive your research data after research completes may be a good choice. 

3. <b>File size</b>: Data repository usually have clear policy for total file size as well as single file size per upload. If you don't have an estimate file size of your reserach, ask your PI or others who has done similiar research for reference. 

4. <b>File type</b>: Data repository could have constriants of file types. Check the documentation of the dataset output file type, software setting or ask IT to know what types of file would be generated from your research.  

5. <b>Access control</b>: Should your research data be public or restricted access? Depends on the funding requirement or policy of your institution, you may be obligated to set open access to your reserch data. Beware that some data repository has open access as default. 

Other features of the repository that may be helpful for your research include version control, uploading a folder, syncing with your desktop, etc.

>[!NOTE] 
>Try different functions of the data repository interface to ensure it fits your needs and use preference.
