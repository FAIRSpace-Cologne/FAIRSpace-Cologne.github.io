### What is data reuse?

Before starting your project, it's worth checking if the data you need is already available. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in data produced by researchers, governments, non-profits, and industries. Rather than generating new datasets, you might benefit from reusing existing ones.

Data reuse refers to utilizing data for purposes beyond its original intent. This practice is especially valuable in science, as it allows researchers to analyze and publish findings independently using the same datasets. Reusability is a core aspect of the FAIR principles.

Data that is well-documented, curated, and shared with clear usage guidelines is more likely to be reused. Combining it with other datasets can unlock new, unforeseen insights and applications.

> [!Important]
> When planning to use data collected by others, there are several key factors to consider:
> - The data’s scope and limitations, such as when it was collected and whether it can effectively address your research question.
> - Check if the metadata (information that describes the dataset) provides enough detail to help you assess its suitability.
> - Review the data’s licensing terms to ensure you have the necessary permissions to use and share it in line with your objectives.
>
> The optimal use and reuse of archived data can only be achieved when its accessibility and reusability are guaranteed. The FAIR data principles provide a framework for ensuring that research data is genuinely open and ready for reuse.

### Where can I find existing data to reuse?

A wide range of resources is available for exploring secondary datasets. Finding research data can be challenging due to the vast amount of available data and the variety of sources and formats. Data that follows the FAIR principles—providing a persistent identifier and rich metadata in searchable resources—tends to be easier to find compared to data on personal websites or as supplementary material in journal articles.

<details>
<summary><strong>Research data repositories/Portals/Search engines</strong></summary>

There are national and international online databases that house research data. Typically, this data can be downloaded and reused. These platforms index a wealth of domain-specific and general datasets.

Examples:
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org): The Registry of Research Data Repositories is a great place to start for finding data across various subject areas.
- [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org): A catalog of databases described using BioDBcore guidelines, including information about the standards used in each one.
- [EU Open Data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/home): Offers a wide range of data, including geographic, geopolitical, financial, statistical, electoral, legal, crime, health, environmental, transport, and scientific research data.
- [DataCite Metadata Search](https://search.datacite.org): Provides a large index of research data by gathering metadata for each DOI. You can use it to find datasets, get statistics, and explore connections.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Data journals</strong></summary>

Journals such as *Scientific Data* provide peer-reviewed descriptions of datasets with significant reuse potential.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Within research articles</strong></summary>

Publishers are pushing authors to include information on how to access the data behind their research. So, when you’re looking through journal articles or other literature, you might find links and DOIs (digital object identifiers) that show you how to get and use the data from the article itself. These datasets can be found in supplementary materials sections or within the aforementioned data repositories associated with the journal.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Government and public data sources</strong></summary>

Government websites such as Data.gov (UK, USA, Australia), Data.gouv (France), and govdata.de (Germany) provide extensive public datasets from their respective countries.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Contacting Authors</strong></summary>

If you find a research paper without a description of where to find the data of interest, you may contact the authors to ask about accessing the underlying datasets.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>External organizations</strong></summary>

If you are obtaining existing data, that are not publicly available, from an external organization (e.g. hospital), a data agreement needs to be put in place. Contact your supervisor/data steward.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, while finding existing research data is valuable, it’s essential to ensure that the data is properly cited, used according to its license, and relevant to your research goals. Always adhere to data usage policies and ethical guidelines when reusing data.

### Legal Considerations for Data Reuse

When reusing existing data, it's important to adhere to the specified conditions for access and use. You might face restrictions due to factors like confidentiality or intellectual property rights.

- **Open vs. restricted data**: Some data is freely available for use, while other data may have specific access and usage conditions. Understand whether the data falls into open or restricted categories.
- **Understanding terms and conditions & owner consent**: Review the terms of access and use, ideally provided through an access category, license, or user agreement. If not explicitly stated, determine how to access and use the data and obtain any necessary permissions by contacting the owner/author directly.
- **Consent and Ethical Approval**: Ensure that the data were collected ethically and that reusing it complies with any consent agreements (check if reconsent is needed).
- **Proper citation**: Cite the data in your publications as required by the access and use conditions. Proper citation is also a key aspect of research integrity, so always acknowledge the original sources of the data.
